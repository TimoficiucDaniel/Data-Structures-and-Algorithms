Data Structures and Algorithms -Lab 1: Dynamic ArrayImplement  in  C++  the  given container(ADT)  using  a given  representation  and  a dynamic  arrayas a data structure. You are not allowed to use the vectorfrom STL or from any other library.Obs:-Since your implementationwill use dynamic allocation, it is a good practice to implement a destructor,  copy  constructor  and  assignment  operator  as  well  (even  if  they  are  not  on  the interface).-You are not allowed to use  the functionsmemcpyand realloc, becauseit is not  safe to use memcpy and realloc on memory  that  was  allocated with new. Also, if the  memory location contains  objects,  undefined  behavior  can  occur. Theimplementation  might  still  work  with these functions, but it is not a good practice to use them.-If you need auxiliary functions, fell free  to add them to the interface of the ADT,  but  make them private.1.ADT Matrix –represented as a sparse matrix, using a dynamicarray of triples <line, column, value>  (value ≠0),  ordered  lexicographically  considering  the  <line,  column>  of  every element.2.ADT  Matrix –represented  as  a  sparse  matrix,  compressed  sparse  column  representationusing dynamic arrays.3.ADT Matrix–represented as a sparse matrix, compressed sparse  line  representationusing dynamic arrays.4.ADT  Bag –represented usinga  dynamic  array  of<element,  frequency>  pairs  (or  two dynamic arrays).For example, the bag [5, 10, -1, 2, 3, 10, 5, 5, -5] will be represented as [(5,3), (10, 2), (-1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1),(-5, 1)]5.ADT Bag –represented as a dynamic array of frequencies.For example, the bag [5, 10, -1, 2, 3, 10, 5, 5, -5] will be represented as [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], built in the following way: -the interval of values [-5, 10] is translated into the interval [0, 16]of positions-at  position  0  we  have  the  frequency  of -5  (minimum  element),  on  position  1  we have the frequency of -4, ..., on position 15 we have the frequency of 10 (maximum element).6.ADT  Bag –represented  as  a  dynamicarray  of  unique  elements  (U)  and  a dynamicarray  of positions (P) in U of the elements from the Bag. For example, the bag [5, 10, -1, 2, 3, 10, 5, 5, -5] will be represented as:U = [5, 10, -1, 2, 3, -5]P = [0, 1, 2, 3,4, 1, 0, 0, 5]
7.ADT  SortedBag –having  elements  of  type TComp,represented  using a  dynamic  array  of <element,   frequency>   pairs(or   two   dynamic   arrays),   sorted   using   a   relation  on   the elements.8.ADT  SortedBag –having  elements of  type TComp,sorted  using  a  relation  on the  elementsand stored in a dynamic array.9.ADT  SortedSet –having  elements  of  type TComp,  sorted  using  a  relation  on  the  elementsand stored in a dynamic array.10.ADT Set–represented as a dynamic array of elements.11.ADT Set –represented as a dynamic array of Boolean values.For example the set {5, 1, -4, 0, 8} can be represented as an array of 13 elements where position 0 corresponds to element -4,  position  1  corresponds  to  element -3, ..., position  12  corresponds  to  element  8:  [true, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false, true, false, false, true].12.ADT  Queue –represented  on  a  circular  dynamic  array+ ADT  Stack–represented  on  a dynamic array.13.ADT Map –represented as a dynamicarray of <key, value> pairs.14.ADT  Sorted  Map –represented  as  a  dynamicarray  of  <key,  value>  pairs,  sorted  using  a relation over the keys.
