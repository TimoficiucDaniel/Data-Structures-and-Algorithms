Lab 5: Binary Search TreeImplement  in  C++  the  given container(ADT)  using  a  given  representation  and  a binary  search tree  (BST)as  a  data  structure.  You  are  not  allowed  to  use any container  or  data  structurefrom  STL or from any other library.Do  not  implement  a  separate  class  for  the binary  search  tree(or  for  the  dynamic  array), implement the container directly!


13.ADT SortedMultiMapâ€“using  a BSTwith linked  representation with  dynamic  allocation.  Inthe BSTunique keys are stored with a dynamic array of the associated values.
